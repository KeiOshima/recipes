    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pick over and hull strawberries. Cut in half or slice, depending on
        size. Gently crush about a quarter of the berries with a fork to release
        their juices. Mix with remaining berries and the 1/2 cup of sugar,
        adding more sugar if necessary. Set aside, covered, for about half an
        hour to develop flavor.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees.</li>
      <li>
        Into a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, salt
        and baking powder. Add 3/4 cup of softened butter, and rub into dry
        ingredients as for pastry. Add 1 1/4 cups cream, and mix to a soft
        dough. Knead the dough for one minute on a lightly floured pastry board,
        then roll it out to about 1/2-inch thickness. Using a 3-inch biscuit
        cutter, cut an even number of rounds - 2 rounds per serving
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a little of the butter to grease a baking sheet. Place half the
        rounds on it. Melt remaining butter and brush a little on the rounds;
        place remaining rounds on top. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until
        golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven, and pull shortcakes apart. Brush the insides with
        some of the remaining melted butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat remaining cream until it thickens. Add vanilla. Beat again just
        until thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a bottom half of a shortcake on each plate. Top with a generous
        spoonful of berries. Cover with a top half, add a few more berries, and
        top with whipped cream. Serve immediately.
