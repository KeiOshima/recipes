    <h2>What are soy suace eggs?</h2>
    <p>
      Soy sauce eggs are simply eggs that have been hardboiled and placed in a
      liquid that is comprised mostly of soy sauce and other ingeredients that
      is meant to deepen the flavor of the egg. Such eggs are commonly used in
      japanese dishes like ramen.
    </p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 tablespoons warm water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar</li>
      <li>
        3/4 cup soy sauce (we used low-sodium—if yours is regular strength, you
        might want to err on the side of shorter marination time)
      </li>
      <li>6 large eggs</li>
      <li>Maldon or other flaky salt, for serving</li>
      <li>Black pepper, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, whisk together the water and sugar to dissolve the
        sugar, then stir in the sherry vinegar and soy sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Carefully put the eggs into the
        boiling water and cook for exactly 6 minutes and 50 seconds, stirring
        slowly for the first 1 1/2 minutes to distribute the heat evenly.
        Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with cold water and ice. When the eggs are
        done, transfer them to the ice bath.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the eggs are cool (and the water isn't uncomfortably icy), peel
        them (in the water—this will help them keep a perfect exterior).
        Transfer the eggs to the soy sauce mixture and marinate in the fridge
        for at least 2, and up to 6, hours, making sure they are completely
        submerged. If necessary, top the eggs with a small plate to ensure
        submersion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the eggs from the sweet and salty solution. You can save the soy
        sauce mix for another round of eggs, if you wish. The eggs will keep,
        refrigerated in a tightly sealed container, for up to a month.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, cut the eggs in half lengthwise and season with salt and
        pepper. Or Cool Hand Luke them to impress your friends.
